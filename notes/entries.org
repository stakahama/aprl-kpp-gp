Editing to ensure double precision
- ROOT_InitializeAER.f90
- ROOT_PartitionAER.f90 (this was okay)

Also changed input_file (len=7) to runpath (len=6)
- outputs were in_outputs/input{dd}
- now in run_{dd}/

default was input_file="std-def," now runpath="run_def"

- created "kpp_edit_initialize_gasphase.py"
* <2015-02-25 Wed>

extra/process.py renamed to extra/format_output.py. now renames in place (removed os.path.basename call)

* <2015-02-27 Fri>

Major modification to modify initial gas-phase concentrations, time, and temperature/CFACTOR after building .exe.

INITVALUES needs to use 1E10 notation (not 1D10)!

Added minconc: 1e-16 seems to work while 0 fails. Possible option to also check for negativity(?) in output of gas-phase/input of partitioning module currently commented out (in ROOT_PartitionAER.f90).
