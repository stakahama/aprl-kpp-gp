Editing to ensure double precision
- ROOT_InitializeAER.f90
- ROOT_PartitionAER.f90 (this was okay)

Also changed input_file (len=7) to runpath (len=6)
- outputs were in_outputs/input{dd}
- now in run_{dd}/

default was input_file="std-def," now runpath="run_def"

- created "kpp_edit_initialize_gasphase.py"
